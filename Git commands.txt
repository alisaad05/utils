# Create new folder 
git init

# two important settings
git config --global user.name 
git config --global user.email

# Before anything, you should pull from github
# To do so we need to define ssh keys for secure connection 
# Method 1: download and install Github desktop (no need for admin privileges)
# Method 2: manually define ssh keys and add them in Github account
# (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

# Once done, test connection:
ssh -T git@github.com

### Manage remotes:
# Check remotes (via verbose):
git remote -v  

# Add remotes (url is usually like: git@githib.com:username/repo_name):
git remote add remote_name remote_url

# Change remote url
git config 	remote.remote_name.url 	new_url
#or (new way)
git remote set-url remote_name 	new_url

#and finally workflow:
#pull from online repo:
git pull  remote_name  master
# i think origin is like the default remote, so "git pull" is equivalent to "git pull origin master" ??

#work with files, add then commit locally (dont forget to set-up ur .gitignore so that u can add the files u need only)
git add .    # there is a "DOT" after add
git commit -m "my_message of commit"

#then send (push) commits to server
git push remote_name master

#Make "origin" the default upstream remote branch (use only "Git push")
git push --set-upstream origin master

# and we re done !! easy right ?
